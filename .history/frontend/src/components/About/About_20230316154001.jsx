                  My passion for <b>computers science engineering</b> started at a young age, and since then, I have been actively pursuing my dreams of becoming a <b>full stack web developer</b>. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently maintained a strong academic record, achieving <b>9.2 CGPA</b> in my first year.
                  In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning new skills. I have completed several online courses in [Your Area of Interest], which has helped me gain a deeper understanding of the industry and the latest trends.
